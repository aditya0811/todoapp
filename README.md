# TODO APP

## Softwares Required
This project is about creating a REST API using django, postgres and implementing CRUD operations. I have not used any frontend technologies instead used POSTMAN software for sending requests.

For using this api you have to install following softwares
1. [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)-You can use any other editor
3. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)- If you have experience with frontend technologies you can integrate it, but here I used postman just to check whether our API is working      fine or not.
4. [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)- I used Postgres Database, you can use any other Relational Database.
5. [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)- It is a Database Management system for postgres.


## Libraries Required
Following are the libraries that you would require

```
pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
pip install django
pip install psycopg2
```
